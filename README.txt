Typing Speed Test
This typing speed tester has three different difficulty modes. Currently the three different texts are hard coded however, the goal is to fetch random texts of different lengths based on the difficulty selected.
The stopwatch stops as soon as the text is completed and the border of the text area changes color based on correctness.
